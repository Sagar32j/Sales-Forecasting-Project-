# Sales-Forecasting-Project-
A Sales Forecasting project using Data Analysis and Machine Learning. It includes data cleaning, EDA, and predictive modeling to forecast future sales. Helps businesses in inventory planning, demand prediction, and strategic decision-making with actionable insights.

**ðŸ“Š Sales Forecasting Project**
**Overview**

This project focuses on Sales Forecasting by leveraging historical sales data to predict future demand. Accurate forecasting is critical for businesses in retail and e-commerce as it directly impacts inventory management, revenue planning, and strategic decision-making.

**Goal**

The primary goal of this project is to develop reliable forecasting models that can estimate future sales trends while considering seasonality, promotions, and long-term growth patterns.

**Approach**

**1.Data Collection & Preprocessing**

Collected historical sales data from retail/e-commerce domain.

Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and performed feature engineering.

Prepared the dataset for time-series modeling by ensuring stationarity and proper indexing.

**2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Conducted in-depth EDA to identify seasonal sales trends, promotional spikes, and yearly growth.

Visualized patterns using line plots, heatmaps, and moving averages.

Discovered insights such as peak demand periods and slow-moving phases.

**3.Modeling Techniques**

Implemented and compared multiple forecasting models:

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): For trend and stationary data forecasting.

Facebook Prophet: For capturing seasonality and promotional events.

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): Deep learning approach for complex sequential patterns.

Each model was tuned and evaluated using error metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.

Visualization & Insights
Plotted forecast vs. actual sales to analyze performance.

Compared models to identify the best-performing technique.

Highlighted business insights such as the impact of promotions on sales and future demand surges.

**Results**

Generated accurate forecasts with high reliability.

Identified key sales patterns that help businesses optimize inventory, pricing strategies, and promotional planning.

Delivered actionable insights to reduce stockouts and overstocking issues.

**Tech Stack**

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels)

Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations

Jupyter Notebook for analysis
